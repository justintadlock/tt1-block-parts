# TT1 Block Parts

This is a proof of concept for adding a block-based header template part to a classic theme.  Instead of forking an original theme, I created a child theme of Twenty Twenty-One to show only the necessary pieces of code that needed to be overwritten to use this new feature.

A full tutorial is available on Gutenberg Times on the process: [Building a Block-Based Header Template in a Classic Theme](https://gutenbergtimes.com/building-a-block-based-header-template-in-a-classic-theme/).
